# Summary
[A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.]

CDP Tools is a Python package to retrieve, package, store, and process data required by CouncilDataProject instances. 

- Describe each component of CDPTools and what it does 
- Describe what an instance is amd how it fits into the CDP architecture 
- Use SeattleCDP as an example

# Statement of Need
[A clear Statement of Need that illustrates the research purpose of the software.]  

City councils across the country publish a variety of open data to the web, including video and audio recordings of meetings, legislative documents, and voting records of elected officials. However, these valuable data sources are often published in disparate locations and in formats that make their content difficult to find and use. For example, raw video and audio files have accessibility issues prohibiting those with hearing or seeing impairments from meaningfully engaging with their elected officials. This lack of accessible open data also prohibits research into local government deliberation, voting, and legislation that are critical to a healthy functioning democracy. 

The CDPTools provides a technical architecture to overcome these limitations. CDPTools provides a XXX to harvest city council data from a variety of sources and transforms these data into accessible formats. CDP also publishes this data as a web archive with a user interface that allows for keyword queries to be performed, voting records to be easily compared, and documents to be linked to debates that occur during a city council meeting. 

This enalbes political science research on a scale previously not possible.
